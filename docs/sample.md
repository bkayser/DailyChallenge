# Intro to HTML

HTML is a way to write text on a page so that it has lots of formatting.  You can make documents that look like they were edited in Google Pages or Microsoft Word but without having to use a special editor.  Instead you just write text with some additional hints embedded in it that tell the web browser how the text should look.  These hints are called "tags".

### Using Tags

An HTML tag appears in an HTML document and looks like `<THIS>` with the two angle brackets either side.  

To use a tag, you surround the text with an "open" tag that looks like `<TAG>` and a "close" tag that looks the same as the open, but has a forward slash in front, like `</TAG>`

There are many different tags you can use to write HTML pages.  Here are some:

* *H1* is a BIG heading.  That's what the title above uses
* *H2*... *H4* are additional heading tags.  The higher the number, the smaller.
* *P* tag is what surrounds a regular paragraph.
* *B* tag surrounds text that you want to be *bold*.

### Examples

So a title would look like this:

```HTML
<H1>Intro to HTML</H1>
```

You can write *BOLD* and _Italic_ text like this.

You can even write **BOLD and Italic** text together.

```HTML
You can write <B>BOLD</B> and <EM>Italic</EM> text like this.

You can even write <B><EM>BOLD and Italic</EM></B> text together.
```
