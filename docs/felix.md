# Welcome to Felixâ€™s Daily Challenge

Last week you learned some basic unix commands including `man`, `ls`, `wc` and `cat`.

Remember, google is your friend!  You can find out how to do all of these things using google as well as the `man` command.

1. Click on [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forumone/The-Raven/master/raven.txt).  Look familiar?  
2. Using the `ssh` command open a remote shell on your server under the user "pi" (not "minecraft").  You can do this from your laptop or Elliott's laptop.  By "your server" I mean the Raspberry PI server named `beetgang`.
3. Change directory to the "Documents" directory.
4. Type the command: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forumone/The-Raven/master/raven.txt`
5. What did that do?  Look at the output of the command, and look at the files in the directory.
6. Use the `cat` command to print the contents of the file `raven.txt`.
7. Use the `grep` command to print the contents of the file `raven.txt` that contain the word "nevermore".  Use the man page or google to figure out how to do this.
8. Use the same command in 7 but add a command line option (begins with the `-` character) so it prints lines that contain nevermore "case-insensitive".  This means it will print lines matching "nevermore" regardless of whether "nevermore" is capitalized or not.  Again, use google or the man page to figure out which option to use.

Now show me the results or email them to me.
