# Welcome to Felixâ€™s Daily Challenge

We're going to start on the Unity 3D course this week.  

### Monday, July 6

Today is about getting set up.  You'll need to get your laptop set up with Unity and Visual Studio Code.

Instructions are all on the course site.

1. Get your laptop and go to the Bonus Room.
2. I'll queue up the video on the TV and we can work through the installation instructions together.  I'll make sure my laptop is up to date.
