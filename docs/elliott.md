# Elliot's Daily Challenges


### Thursday, June 18

1. On your computer, open a terminal window and type `ls`.
2. Send me the results.

What does ls show you?

### Friday, June 18

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Type `ls`.
3. Type `ls -l`.
4. Notice how those commands show different things.  Can you tell what the difference is?
5. Type `ls -lh`.
6. Copy the output of `ls -lh` and paste it into an email message to me.
7. Based on the output of `ls -lh` find the biggest file in your directory and tell me how big it is.  You can tell me in units of `kb` or `mb` or even `gb` if you see that.  Type your answer into the email.

### Saturday, June 19

1. Open a terminal window.  Type `ls` to see the files in the current working directory.
2. Type `pwd`.  This is a command that means "Print the working directory"
3. Type `cd Documents`.  The `cd` command means "Change the working directory".
4. Type `ls` to look at the files in the current working directory.  What do you see?
4. Now type `pwd`.  How is this different than what `pwd` printed before?
5. Now type `cd ..` and then type `pwd`.  What is the current working directory now?
6. Again, type `cd ..` and then type `pwd`.  What is the current working directory now?
7. One more time, type `cd ..` and then type `pwd`

Now create a new email message to bill@kayser.org and answer the following two questions:

1. What is a directory?
2. What happens when you type `cd ..`?

### Sunday, June 20, Father's Day

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Type `no`.  What happens?  There is no unix command called `no`.  That would be silly.  So the shell prints out an error.
3. Type `yes`.  What happens?  Uh-oh!
4. Type `<ctrl-c>`.  That means, hold down the "control" key and press the letter "C".  What did that do?

'<ctrl-c>' is a command that almost always "interrupts" a running command or program that you started in the terminal window.

Now, create a new email message to bill@kayser.org saying "Happy Fathers Day".  For a bonus, copy and paste a funny image into the email.  Get Felix to help if he's in the mood.

### Monday, June 21

Review `ls` and `pwd` commands.

### Tuesday, June 22

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Using the command `mkdir` create a new directory in your current working directory.  Call this directory "fun".
3. Go into the new "fun" directory.  Hint: Use the command that you have been using to "change directory".
4. Type the following command: `ls > foo`.  Normally the `ls` command lists all the files in the directory but this time it printed nothing out!  
5. Type `ls`.  There should be a new file in the fun directory called `foo`.
6. What do you think is in the `foo` file?  Let's find out by printing the contents of `foo`.  Type the command `cat foo`.  What do you see?
7. What do you think the command `ls > foo` does?  Write your answer in an email and send it to me.

If you have any problems or don't have an answer for (7) come find me and I'll help you.
