# Elliott's Daily Challenges

You are doing great with Khan Academy!  You are learning the basics of computer programming.

But we are going to switch for a few days and have you review some Chinese stuff.  You can keep on working on
Khan Academy if you want but it's important for you to do the Chinese review that Mrs. Walter gave you.
