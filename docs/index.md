# Welcome to the Daily Challenge!

**Bookmark this page!**

Each day you'll be asked to answer a simple technical (Data Nerd) question.  The instructions will be specific and tell you how to submit the answer.
Once I receive your correct answer I will disable the internet pause for that afternoon.

If you don't complete the challenge in time, you'll have to solve it using a computer that is not blocked.
This includes my computer in my office if I'm not using it, one of the mac laptops, and the Chromebook.

All challenges can be solved with any of these computers.

You can solve the challenges as far in advance as you like.
